# Title

Image Classification


## Introduction
In this project,we'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. We'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At the end, will see their predictions on the sample images.

The dataset will come from [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
