# Project Title

Use of Recurrent Neural Network in Image Classification


## Introduction
This was my second project in 17-week Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation.In this project, the images from the CIFAR-10 dataset were classified.The dataset consists of images such as airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.

Further Steps involved:
- The dataset needs to be preprocessed.
- Training of convolutional neural network on all the samples.
- The images were normalized and the labels were to be one-hot encoded
- The Building of a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.
- Finally, the predictions were observed on the sample images.
